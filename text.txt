About Trucks24

Trucks24 was founded in 2018, When we become tired of dealing with late shipments, dameged or stolen goods during shipments, or by later founding out that we overpaid for the transportation cost and then we realised that we are not the only one's facing these problems. That is the day when two lifelong friends Gaurav Rajora and Vibhanshu Sharma decided to start Trucks24 with the goal of transforming the transportation sector.
